- make the results independent of build-path
- make the results independent of libc, or as independent as possible
- set different CFLAGS for the same compiler

- use ICC which one can get as freeware on intel's website

Perhaps use the following:

Unfortunately most of these don't seem to provide binary releases, so we'd
have to build them using GCC anyway. This may still have some security benefit -
it would test the sophistication of any backdoors in GCC, since they'd have to
be able to insert themselves into all of these - but it's not obvious how to
quantify the amount of security benefit we do gain; it may be negligible.
